  Scenario: Create an Chemistry using TinyMCE
    Given I log in as "admin"
    When I open my profile in edit mode
    And I set the field "Description" to "<p>Chemistry test</p>"
    # Set field on the bottom of page, so chemistry editor dialogue is visible.
    And I expand all fieldsets
    And I set the field "Picture description" to "Test"
    And I expand all toolbars for the "Description" TinyMCE editor
    And I click on the "Chemistry editor" button for the "Description" TinyMCE editor
    And the "class" attribute of "Edit chemistry using" "field" should contain "text-ltr"
    And I set the field "Edit chemistry using" to " = 1 \div 0"
    And I click on "\infty" "button"
    And I click on "Save chemistry" "button"
    And I click on "Update profile" "button"
    And I follow "Profile" in the user menu
